# sparc_microct

This repository contains teaching materials designed to introduce university-level students to working with computed tomography (CT) data. It introduces terminology and metadata specific to CT scanning and data analysis and provides step-by-step instructions for four exercises that cover the basics of processing and interpreting CT data collected through the SPARC Project and/or at the MicroCT Imaging Consortium for Research and Outreach (MICRO) facility at the University of Arkansas. 

Portions of this exercise are adapted from: Kasten, M. (2020) Delving into the Boston Fingerprints Project Archive: A SPARC Teaching Resource. https://github.com/ropitz/sparc_teaching.
