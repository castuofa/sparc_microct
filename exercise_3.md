# Exercise 3: Collecting basic measurements from your object

The goal of this exercise is to:
* Learn how to collect measurements from microCT data and surface models
* Understand the basics of placing 3D landmarks for geometric morphometric analysis

This exercise will focus on how to collect a variety of measurements (e.g., depth/width/thickness, curvature/angulation, area/volume) on both your original microCT stack and any models you created from the microCT data. You will learn how to take these measurements in multiple different programs, depending on your analytical needs. 

One major application of microCT data and/or 3D models more broadly is to perform shape analyses using the methods of geometric morphometrics. This technique employs two- (X,Y) or three-dimensional (X,Y,Z) landmarks to summarize and analyze the shape of an object compared to other similar objects or specimens. We will not go into the methods of geometric morphometrics here, or the philosophy and reasons behind where to place informative landmarks, but more details on these techniques are readily available and we encourage you to seek out prior publications with comparable data to those you are working with if you wish to implement these methods. 

#### Collecting linear measurements In FIJI/ImageJ
First let’s open up the civil war femur stack in FIJI/ImageJ. Before you do anything, you will need to confirm that the scale of the data is properly set. If you have just imported the original DICOM dataset for this specimen then the scale should automatically be set. If you are importing a TIFF stack, you will most likely need to set the scale yourself. Remember that you can view the file properties by going to Image>Show Info. Look for the “voxel size” information and compare that against the metadata for your data. Refer to Exercise 1 if the voxel size is set to 1x1x1 (1 is the default import size for unscaled data). 

In some instances you may further want to set the scale before you collect any measurements. Navigate to Analyze>Set Scale. If there’s a scale bar somewhere in your image (for a 2D image) or if there is an object of known size in one of your slices, you can use the line tool to make a line and then tell FIJI how long the line is. However, in our case you should have the voxel size from the scan data; if the voxel sizes are properly set in your image stack properties you should be ready to go. Even with this it might be good to take a quick measurement to confirm that it makes sense in regard to how large the actual object is. After you set/confirm the scale, taking measurements is as simple as using the line tool and telling ImageJ to record the length of that line. Select the line tool from the main toolbar, place the endpoint of the line across the part of the slice you wish to measure, and then you can either record the length of the line from the readout on the tool bar or go to Analyze>Measure (Ctrl+M) and the measurement (any additional measurements after that) will be placed into a table that can then be exported. Use a similar process to calculate areas (use the freehand selection or polygon tool) or angles. Your screen will look something like this as you set your scale and take measurements:
